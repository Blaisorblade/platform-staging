The first release of `sbt-platform` is a prototype that includes an experimental
set of features. This set will be modified until we reach a stable version, but
the general idea is the same: simplifying getting useful sbt plugins together and
automating project management, keys definition and the release process.

Adds:
* Integration with `sbt-pgp`.
* Integration with `sbt-coursier`.
* Integration with `bintray-sbt`.
* Integration with `sbt-release`.
* Integration with `sbt-mima-plugin`.

In short, this is what the plugin is capable of:
* Automatic detection of common keys from the context (like `scmInfo`).
* Releasing nightlies automatically.
* Signing artifacts with Scala Platform keys (only available in the CI).
* Integration with Drone and environment keys to let people write their own scripts.
* Automatic checks in user-defined versions (stop the users from using already published versions).
* Automatic execution of MiMa on artifacts prone to binary compatibility (>0.x.x).
