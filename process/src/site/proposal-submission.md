# Submit a proposal

The Scala Platform is shaped through Scala Platform proposals, documents
that propose the inclusion of a library into the Platform to fulfill a
concrete need. Proposals explain why such need is desirable and why the
suggested library is the best fit for the Scala community.

If you want to submit a library proposal, follow these steps:

1.  [*Open a Discourse discussion thread*](http://internals.scala-lang.org)
    describing your idea to get feedback from the Community. Share this link in
    Gitter channels and with other developers whose feedback you consider
    important.
2.  After two weeks, the Process Lead invites you to submit it, picks a
    reviewer and schedules its discussion for the next available Scala Platform meeting.
3.  The reviewer presents the proposed idea. The Committee votes it.
4.  The Committee selects and ranks other potential modules by widespread
    use and approachability. The Committee makes sure they all have
    maintainers willing to participate into the SPP process.
5.  The Committee incubates the highest-ranked project per category, e.g.
    IO, JSON, property-based testing suite, unit testing
    framework, etc.
6.  The Incubation process helps maintainers focus on preparing for the first
    stable release and building a community of developers that contribute in
    this process. After Maintainers get a feeling of how to work together and
    stabilise the codebase (if required), they ask for a review.
    
    The incubation process lasts, at maximum, six months. The Committee
    will review an incubated project when both Mantainers and reviewer agree
    that the project is ready. Modules are merged when they:
    *  Have passed their incubation period;
    *  Have *at least* one committer cutting releases and maintaining them; and,
    *  Abide by the Code of Conduct.
    
7.  If past the incubation time a module doesn't meet the requirements,
    the second highest-ranked project is incubated instead.
8.  Modules are withdrawn from the Platform when they fall unmaintained.

## What happens after?

After getting the approval from the Committee and passing the incubation
period, the module lifetime begins. It is then merged in the next
release of the Platform.

As this is the hardest phase of a module, the Scala Platform process
provides policies and help managing the project. These policies enforce
the Platform contract and make sure that modules abide by some minor
common rules.
