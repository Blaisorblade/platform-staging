# Incubation

When the Committee decides to incubate your project, the Process lead
will add the current module maintainers to the [`scalaplatform` GitHub organization](https://github.com/scalaplatform).

The incubation process is key for the development of a module. It's the call for
action for those who want to get involved and help out in its evolution. While
some Platform modules with a strong presence in the Community may not need to get
contributors, polish docs, and prepare for a stable release, the incubation period
helps the maintainers to get a feeling of the process, increase their userbase and get
more committed contributors.

> Given the compatibility requirements defined in the Platform release process, it
> is very important that the public API of an incubated module has seen several iterations
> before a stable release, and is stable enough to last for 18 months.

## The infrastructure

The incubation process and the integration with the infrastructure
is meant to be as easy as possible, so that you can focus on the hard tasks:
* Growing your community;
* Tooling around your project;
* Fixing bugs;
* Preparing for a release.

As an incubated project, you have access to all the Scala Platform infrastructure.

The infrastructure consists of:

1. Continuous Integration servers.
1. The Platform sbt release plugin.
1. The nightly release bot.
